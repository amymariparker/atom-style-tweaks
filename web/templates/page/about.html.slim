      # About Atom Tweaks

      Atom Tweaks is a database of simple tweaks for the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io). These
      are simple changes to one's environment that don't merit a full
      [Atom package](https://atom.io/packages). Atom is very customizable because you can add these
      small snippets that can radically change your editing environment. In the past, finding and
      integrating these little chunks of code was a time-consuming and error-prone process. Atom
      Tweaks seeks to solve all of that!
